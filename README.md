## About

Hello! I'm Luis Fernando from Ecuador. Currently, I work as a Software Developer Architect. I'm passionate about the Web3 world, Blockchain, and Fullstack development on Ethereum. I love taking on challenges, constantly learning, traveling, indulging in culinary delights, and immersing myself in new cultures.\
\
The phrase that reflects my focus in this stage of my life is "Senri no michi mo, ippou kara," which means "A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step" 🐺.\
\
I have specialized in web programming with the aim of enhancing user experience. I have an interest in mobile app development. My commitment starts with myself and extends to the world. I strive to create value in the projects I participate in, with the ultimate goal of leaving the world a better place than I found it.
