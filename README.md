Hey there! I'm **Luis Fernando**, also known as **Wolfcito** üê∫, hailing from Ecuador üá™üá®. I‚Äôm a **Software Development Architect** with a deep passion for **Web3** and **Blockchain** technologies. With years of experience across full-stack development, I focus on building scalable solutions and exploring decentralized systems like **Ethereum EVM** and **Layer 2 protocols** (e.g., **Optimism, Mode Network**).

Currently, I‚Äôm a **Tech-Cooperator** at **Mode Network**, contributing to innovative blockchain solutions, and also an **Ambassador for Push Protocol**, engaging with the vibrant **Web3** community.

When I‚Äôm not deep in code, you can find me exploring new cultures, traveling, and indulging in diverse cuisines. My personal motto is inspired by the Japanese proverb: *"Senri no michi mo, ippou kara"* ‚Äî *"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."*

I believe in leaving the world better through tech by creating meaningful, user-centered experiences. Let‚Äôs connect, collaborate, and build the future together!
