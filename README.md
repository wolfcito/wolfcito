## About

Hello! I'm Luis Fernando from Ecuador. Currently, I work as a Software Developer Architect. I'm passionate about the Web3 world, Blockchain, and Fullstack Development on Ethereum. I love taking on challenges, constantly learning, traveling, indulging in culinary delights, and immersing myself in new cultures.
\
The phrase that reflects my focus in this stage of my life is "Senri no michi mo, ippou kara," which means "A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step" üê∫.
\
I have specialized in web programming, aiming to enhance user experience, and I also have a keen interest in mobile app development. I am always committed to building a new and better world.
