## About

Hello everyone! I'm Luis Fernando from Ecuador. Currently, I work as a Software Developer Architect. I've the oportunity to built solutions from scratch to deploy it in production. I'm passionate about technology usually I work with Java, Sql and right now I am so excited with the Web 3.0 world, Blockchain, and Fullstack development on Ethereum and L2 like Optimism.üöÄ  I love taking on challenges, constantly learning, traveling, indulging in culinary delights, and immersing myself in new cultures.\
\
The phrase that reflects my focus in this stage of my life is "Senri no michi mo, ippou kara" which means "A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step" üê∫\
