![Trustless by design](public/trustless-by-design-gh.png)

Building programmable trust infrastructure for autonomous agents.

---

Autonomous agents will execute value onchain.  
Trust must be verifiable, enforceable, portable, and monetizable.

DenLabs designs the primitives that make that possible.

---

## Infrastructure Focus

- Policy enforcement layers for agent actions (`allow · limit · block`)
- Trust decision APIs and SDK-ready interfaces
- Composable standards for multi-agent and cross-chain systems
- Monetizable infrastructure surfaces (API-first)

Explorers show activity.  
Infrastructure enforces decisions.

## Systems in Progress

- **DenScope** — Event-driven trust intelligence
- **Ayni** — Trust oracle for agent marketplaces
- **ModeSpray** — Token distribution infrastructure
- **trust-sdk** — Composable verification primitives

---

## Approach

- Primitive over feature
- API over UI
- Enforcement over dashboards
- Standards over one-offs
