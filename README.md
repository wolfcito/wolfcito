## My journey

Hey there! I'm Luis Fernando, also known as Wolfcito, hailing from Ecuador. I’m a Software Developer Engineer with a deep passion for Web3 and Blockchain technologies. With years of experience across full-stack development, I focus on building scalable solutions and exploring decentralized systems like Ethereum EVM and Layer 2 protocols (e.g., Optimism, Mode Network).

Currently, I’m a Tech-Cooperator at Mode Network, contributing to innovative blockchain solutions, and also an Ambassador for Push Protocol, engaging with the vibrant Web3 community. As I advance in my development journey, I’m now diving deeper into the governance of the Web3 ecosystem, contributing as a delegate for Push Protocol and exploring governance models in ecosystems like Optimism and Mode Network. These efforts align with my core principles as a cooperator and contributor, leveraging my strong technical background to bring meaningful insights and value to governance processes.

When I’m not deep in code, you can find me exploring new cultures, traveling, and indulging in diverse cuisines. My personal motto is inspired by the Japanese proverb: "Senri no michi mo, ippou kara" — "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."

I believe in leaving the world better through tech by creating meaningful, user-centered experiences. Let’s connect, collaborate, and build the future together!
